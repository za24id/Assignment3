## Tutorial 
The tutorail is very well orgianized and simple. There are a couple minor issues. 1) In the second paragraph of tutorial, please change "th" to "the" 2) In the example, the output of clang is named foo.noopt.ll which is a bit misleading because there IS optimization performed, just not vectorization. I suggest renaming it to foo.novect.ll or something along those lines  

## General comments 
* The example works as expected.
* The vectorization concepts are explained very well.
* The README.md is well organized.
